        "body": "Former President Donald Trump has reacted critically to rumors that President Joe Biden won't face any charges in his classified documents probe, with the former president alleging \"selective prosecution\" since he faces dozens of felony charges in a similar investigation.\n\nMr. Hur and his team are reportedly preparing a detailed report from their year-long investigation into the president, with the unnamed individuals telling CNN that the probe is expected to be critical of President Biden and his staff for their handling of sensitive materials.\n\nA spokesperson from the Department of Justice (DOJ) told The Epoch Times that, since the special counsel's investigation remains ongoing, his office will decline comment.\n\nIn a series of follow-up posts, he wrote: \"Selective prosecution,\" \"Prosecutorial misconduct,\" and \"Unequal justice on the boxes hoax.\"\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly referred to the classified documents case against him as the \"boxes hoax\" while accusing the DOJ of carrying out a politically-driven investigation meant to thwart his White House bid.\n\nIn his classified documents case, President Trump has been charged with a total of 40 felony charges by special counsel Jack Smith in a case that accuses the former president of wilfully retaining classified documents, obstructing justice, and making false statements.\n\nPresident Trump has pleaded not guilty.\n\n\"As we have said from the beginning, the president and the White House are cooperating with this investigation, and as it has been appropriate, we have provided relevant updates publicly, being as transparent as we can, consistent with protecting and preserving the integrity of the investigation,\" Ian Sams, spokesman for the White House Counsel's Office, said in an Oct. 9 statement.\n\nPresident Biden's supporters have argued that his proactive approach to Mr. Hur's classified documents probe stands in contrast to the way President Trump has responded to Mr. Smith's probe.\n\nThat trial, in which President Trump has also denied any wrongdoing, is scheduled to begin in March in Washington, just one day before Super Tuesday. This is typically the busiest day of the presidential primary calendar and will see 16 states and territories hold presidential nominating contests.\n\nThey have also accused Mr. Smith of acting in a \"reckless\" fashion in order to get a conviction before the 2024 election.\n\n\"The special counsel's office is engaged in a reckless effort to try to obtain a conviction of President Trump prior to the 2024 election, no matter the cost,\" his lawyers wrote. \"The Court should not permit the use of the criminal justice process toward that end.\"\n\nPresident Trump is the frontrunner for the 2024 presidential Republican nomination.",

            "body": "Filings center on constitutional provisions surrounding double jeopardy, free speech, and due process, as well as purported evidence of selective prosecution.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's legal team filed several responses on Nov. 22, insisting that U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan dismiss the Justice Department's (DOJ) prosecution because, they argued, the Biden administration selectively and vindictively targeted him while abusing its statutory authority and seeking to violate multiple constitutional protections.\n\nThe three filings represent the latest in a series of pre-trial submissions prompted by President Trump's various motions to dismiss the case. Besides leveling constitutional, statutory, and selective prosecution allegations, the former president has also argued that the case should be dismissed due to the protection he received under the doctrine of presidential immunity.\n\nThe Nov. 22 filings, however, center on constitutional provisions surrounding double jeopardy, free speech, and due process; as well as purported evidence of a selective prosecution directed by President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee and President Trump's chief rival for the White House in 2024.\n\n\"The prosecution seeks to install itself as America's censor, with roving authority to criminally prosecute all who speak out against its approved narratives,\" reads a filing from President Trump's legal team.\n\n\"The prosecution has no such mandate. Accordingly, the indictment is unconstitutional on its face and must be dismissed. Additionally, even if the First Amendment permitted charges on this basis -- which it emphatically does not -- President Trump's acquittal before the United States Senate forecloses retrial before this Court, as do the Constitution's guarantees of due process and fair notice.\"\n\nCompeting interpretations of the First Amendment have been central to the motions to dismiss the DOJ's case as President Trump's attorneys allege that various aspects of the indictment stem from core political speech protected under the U.S. Constitution. Moreover, his attorneys argued, he shouldn't be charged because he was not given fair notice that his conduct would violate the law.\n\nDOJ had defended its indictment on Nov. 6 by alleging that President Trump's legal team had misrepresented their indictment, which targeted purportedly fraudulent and deceptive speech not protected by the First Amendment.\n\n\"The allegations that the defendant sought to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election by resorting to fraud, deceit, and corruption place his conduct well outside the protections afforded by the First Amendment and likewise put him fully on notice that his conduct was criminal and thus subject to prosecution,\" the DOJ wrote in a combined opposition to President Trump's motions to dismiss on statutory and constitutional grounds.\n\n\"Finally, the defendant's prior acquittal in a Senate trial following his impeachment in the House does not foreclose this criminal prosecution, and his particular reliance on the Double Jeopardy Clause is frivolous.\"\n\nPresident Trump's motion to dismiss for selective and vindictive prosecution leverages media reporting about the Biden administration's interests in the former president's conduct and alleges that Special Counsel Jack Smith served as a \"stalking horse\" for President Biden.\n\n\"Despite all of the Special Counsel's self-aggrandizing comments about the supposedly unprecedented nature of his manufactured allegations against President Trump, the truly unprecedented aspect of this case is that a sitting president successfully urged the Department of Justice ... to try to take down his chief political rival and, now, the leading candidate to be the next president,\" President Trump's legal team wrote in a Nov. 22 filing.\n\n\"President Biden was so successful, in fact, that the Special Counsel brought two deeply flawed cases against President Trump and has engaged in a reckless effort to proceed to trial in both as soon as possible -- even while President Biden anxiously waits to learn whether he will be charged with crimes by a different Special Counsel.\"\n\nDOJ argued in a Nov. 6 filing that President Trump's legal team engaged in rank speculation while offering \"nothing more than conspiratorial narratives of prosecutorial bias and abuse.\"\n\n\"This rumor and innuendo is not a substitute for proof, and it falls far short of the sort of clear, objective evidence that is required to support a selective or vindictive prosecution claim,\" it added. \"The defendant fails to satisfy the standard to support a request for discovery, much less the extraordinary step of dismissing the indictment.\"\n\nThe prosecution also claimed that \"there is no evidence that the indictment in this case was returned based upon anything other than the facts and the law.\"",

Fake news CNN, through a leak from the Department of Injustice, has just reported that no charges will be filed in the (much bigger than mine!!!) Crooked Joe Biden documents case,\" Trump said in one post. \"We are living in a very corrupt country!\"\n\nCNN cited \"two sources close to investigation\" in its report on Hur's plans.\n\nHur was appointed in January to investigate Biden's case after documents from his time as vice president were found at his former office in Washington, D.C., and his home in Wilmington, Del.\n\nHur's team has told officials in the Justice Department that it hopes to have the report completed by the end of the year, but that timeline could change, CNN reported.\n\nBiden was interviewed by Hur in early October after documents were found by officials clearing out his old office last November. Biden has maintained he did nothing wrong and his team has repeatedly noted that his lawyers quickly notified the Justice Department and cooperated with it after discovering the documents.\n\nAnd Biden's supporters argue his proactive response paints a crucial contrast with Trump's conduct, which has been drawn criminal charges from special counsel Jack Smith.\n\nTrump and co-conspirators are accused of misleading investigators and withholding documents from various government agencies.\n\nThe National Archives reportedly alerted the Justice Department that Trump possessed more than 300 classified documents after leaving office, which eventually led to the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago property last August.\n\nTrump's trial in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case is set to go to trial in May 2024, though Judge Aileen Cannon appears to be considering postponing the trial until after the presidential elections.",

            "body": "Attorneys for the former president made the filing in the federal 2020 election case.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump in a new court filing alleged former Vice President Mike Pence of attempting to \"curry favor\" with the Department of Justice (DOJ) in his Jan. 6-related case in a bid to evade criminal charges.\n\nThe FBI found more classified documents at the former vice president's house weeks later in February 2023. The investigation reportedly ended in June with no criminal charges being filed against Mr. Pence.\n\n\"The potential criminal charges faced by Vice President Pence gave him an incentive to curry favor with authorities by providing information that is consistent with the Biden Administration's preferred, and false, narrative regarding this case,\" the Trump attorneys wrote in the filing.\n\nAccordingly, the special counsel's office, led by Jack Smith, \"must collect and disclose information maintained\" by the Justice Department and the FBI related to the Pence investigation, \"negotiations\" relating to the FBI search, \"and the decision not to bring charges,\" said the filing. It was referring to the FBI having found the lone document in February, which was described \"as consensual after negotiations\" between the Department of Justice and Mr. Pence's team.\n\nIn June, the DOJ wrote a letter to Mr. Pence's attorney that the FBI and DOJ \"have conducted an investigation into the potential mishandling of classified information\" and that \"based on the results of that investigation, no criminal charges will be sought.\"\n\nIt comes as anonymously sourced reports on Tuesday indicated that Mr. Pence told Mr. Smith's office more details to the special counsel's office amid the investigation into President Trump's alleged election crimes in Washington. The former president has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nThe former vice president has not publicly responded to the latest court filing or the ABC News report. A spokesperson for President Trump, meanwhile, told ABC that \"tens of millions of Americans, including Vice President Pence ... have had grave and serious concerns about the legitimacy of the ... 2020 Presidential Election, further proving that the lawless indictment against President Trump should be summarily dismissed.\"\n\nIt's not clear if the former vice president will testify in the election case, which is scheduled to go to trial in March 2024.\n\nIn a separate court filing made on Monday, President Trump's lawyers sought more information related to election fraud during the 2020 presidential election. His attorneys argued that he had a \"good faith\" basis to question the results, demanding that prosecutors turn over any evidence in the contest.\n\n\"President Trump is entitled to all information supporting his position that his concerns regarding fraud during the 2020 election -- rather than 'knowingly false' or criminal -- were plausible and maintained in good faith,\" his lawyers wrote. \"To prop up the Biden Administration's preferred political advocacy regarding the 2020 election, the indictment endorses the alleged views of 'Senior White House Attorneys,' 'senior leaders of the Justice Department,' 'the Intelligence Community,' the 'Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.'\"\n\nHis team, meanwhile, is also seeking documents related to the investigations into other foreign nation's attempts to influence the 2020 election.\n\n\"Evidence of covert foreign disinformation campaigns relating to the 2020 election supports the defense argument that President Trump and others acted in good faith even if certain reports were ultimately determined to be inaccurate,\" his lawyers wrote in the court filings.\n\nHis lawyers are also seeking to force prosecutors to turn over documents related to the Jan. 6, 2021, breach at the U.S. Capitol. The attorneys are looking in part for statements by prosecutors in other Jan. 6-related cases that they say could conflict with the Smith team's assertion that President Trump was responsible for the incident at the Capitol.\n\nThe Trump attorneys have already asked U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to dismiss the indictment, saying he is shielded from prosecution by presidential immunity, and arguing that the charges violate his First Amendment rights. Those requests are still pending.\n\nAside from the Washington case, President Trump also faces criminal charges in Georgia, New York City, and Florida. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges.\n\nMeanwhile, both he and his company, the Trump Organization, are currently still on trial in New York City in a civil fraud case brought by the state's Democratic attorney general. The Trumps have denied wrongdoing in that case, too, saying it's part of a politically motivated attempt to imperil his presidential bid.",

            "source": "Daily Mail Online",
            "body": "By Kelly Laco, Executive Editor Of Politics For Dailymail.Com\n\nTop Republican Mike Turner says if 'serial classified documents hoarder' Joe Biden is not criminally charged, it will show that the Department of Justice is not 'pursuing Democrats.'\n\nIt was revealed last week that the special counsel appointed to probe the improper storage of classified documents at Biden's Delaware home and think tank is expected to wrap up soon without filing any criminal charges against the president.\n\nTurner, who serves as chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), addressed the reports that Special Counsel Robert Hur is not going to charge Biden, calling it 'devastating.'\n\n'Well, this will be certainly devastating, and continuing to be devastating to the Department of Justice and to the Biden administration with their two-tier system of justice,' Turner said on CBS 'Face the Nation' Sunday.\n\n'You know, Biden has been found to be a serial classified document hoarder over a 10-year period. He's been taking classified documents, some of the most sensitive that threaten our national security home without any protection. And certainly, you know, able to, for others to be able to access them,' he continued.\n\n'I'm very disappointed in the response we're getting from ODNI,' said Turner\n\n'There needs to be consequences,' said the chairman.\n\n'The fact that Hillary Clinton, who had over 100 classified documents when she was secretary of state and Vice President Biden under Obama were taking classified documents home and certainly had them be vulnerable, with no consequences, shows the Department of Justice is not pursuing Democrats.'\n\nTurner told DailyMail.com last week that he was 'disappointed' that there is seemingly no movement in President Biden's classified documents investigation.\n\n'We are very disappointed that there's nothing that appears to be happening on that case,' Turner told DailyMail.com on Thursday.\n\nTurner, who has seen both the Biden and Trump classified documents, say they are 'equally national security threatening documents that should not have been outside of a controlled, classified space.'\n\nHur - who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in January - has been interviewing the president's aides and family members, including Biden himself and son Hunter, but has not issued any public statements throughout the process.\n\nHur's team is reportedly expected to issue a 'sharply critical' detailed report by the end of the year, without filing any criminal charges.\n\nIn contrast, Special Counsel Jack Smith quickly indicted Trump back in July for allegedly unlawfully retaining national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements.\n\n'Biden had these documents for over 10 years. You can't hoard documents in your home for a decade long period, concealing them, taking them home as a senator or vice president and suddenly say hey, two weeks while I was president I cooperated and, therefore, it doesn't count that I spent 10 years as a serial classified document hoarder,' Turner continued on CBS.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal counts and his court date is set for May 2024, which is in the thick of the presidential primary.\n\nTurner also said the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) is stonewalling lawmakers investigating Biden and Trump classified documents scandals.\n\n'I'm very disappointed in the response we're getting from ODNI. We've all seen the [Trump] indictment, and I have seen classified documents from both the Biden and Trump documents. The ones that we have seen from Trump do not match the indictment.'\n\n'And so our inquiry is: show us how the indictment language matches to a document and show us those documents. And we have yet to get a response.'\n\nTurner, who is from Dayton, Ohio, made the comments during a preview of a Republican report on FISA Section 702 abuses and fixes published today.\n\nImages from a Biden campaign video show him backing up his classic Stingray into his garage. He is seen reversing his Corvette into a garage filled with papers at his Wilmington home\n\nBoxes of potentially classified documents were discovered in a Mar-a-Lago bathroom by the DOJ\n\nHe previously told DailyMail.com that it would be 'incredibly difficult' to not find that President Biden had violated the law in how he handled classified materials.\n\nSince reviewing the documents, he had also said that the 'behavior' displayed by Biden and described in the Trump complaint - based on their alleged mishandling of the classified materials - is 'wrong.'\n\n'If you just pull out the statute, it would be incredibly difficult for anyone to not conclude that Biden's actions violate specific statutes,' he previously said.\n\nThe chairman is particularly concerned with the potential 'unequal application' of the law by the Department of Justice in how it handles the Trump documents case compared to the Biden case.\n\nRecords were first unearthed in a private think tank office where the President Biden used to work in Washington in November 2022.\n\nMore documents were found in the president's Wilmington, Delaware garage on December 20 and in his home library on January 12.\n\nBiden has said he did not know the documents were there.",

            "source": "Yahoo News",
            "body": "Famed journalist Bob Woodward rejected the idea that Donald Trump was \"too busy\" to return boxes of classified documents that had been stored at Mar-a-Lago, recalling long conversations he had with the former president at the time while he was researching a book.\n\nMr Trump was served a subpoena by the Department of Justice in 2022 demanding that he turn over any classified documents he had taken from the White House after he left office in 2021. The former president and his team only returned some of the documents, which prompted an FBI raid at Mar-a-Lago last August. The FBI turned up hundreds of more documents that were still being stored in boxes at the golf resort.\n\nThe incident has led to one of Mr Trump's numerous ongoing legal battles as he is accused of withholding and concealing from federal investigators classified and top-secret materials. He has also been accused by DOJ special counsel Jack Smith of directing Mar-a-Lago workers to move boxes around the resort to keep them out of the hands of federal investigators.\n\nMr Trump and the co-defendants have all pleaded not guilty to the federal charges against them, which include conspiracy to obstruct justice.\n\nWoodward, who has written four books focused on Mr Trump and serves as an associate editor of The Washington Post, sat down for an interview on MSNBC during which he recalled the former president frequently insisting he was \"too busy\" to talk for long, but ultimately would spend more time than Woodward had allotted chatting with him.\n\n\"That he's not busy. That it's a way of, oh, I'm busy. I would talk to him, you can hear this on the tapes. He'd say, I can't talk for long, I've got the joint chiefs downstairs. And then he'd talk for 25 minutes,\" Woodward said.\n\nMr Trump is currently attempting to sue Woodward, his publisher, Simon & Schuster, and its parent company, Paramount Global, for releasing 20 recorded interviews the former president had with Woodward for his book Rage. Mr Trump claims he recorded the interviews solely for use in the book, and is accusing Woodward - best known for his Watergate exposes alongside fellow reporter Carl Bernstein in the early 1970s - and his publishers of trying to \"capitalise\" off of his \"valuable\" voice.\n\nThe lawsuit is asking for $49m.\n\nWhile that case navigates the courts, the case against Mr Trump for his alleged concealment of sensitive government information is set to go to trial next year.",

A key issue is that a delay at one stage of the CIPA process can affect the entire trial schedule.\n\nPresident Trump's attorneys wanted the trial to take place after the 2024 election, while Mr. Smith's team has pushed for a faster timetable.\n\nMr. Smith said in the 230 filing that the reason he no longer opposes keeping the documents hidden from the public is because the court earlier ordered full, unredacted versions of the 223 and 224 docket entries to be provided to President Trump's lawyers.\n\n\"Because the Court rejected that position and ordered the Government to provide unredacted versions of the two docket entries to defense counsel, there is no justification for keeping them from the public,\" the special counsel wrote.\n\nCiting the \"high volume\" of classified discovery, the judge wrote it is \"most prudent, given the evolving complexities in this matter, to adjust the first batch of pre-trial deadlines.\" She added that she could not \"ignore the realities\" of President Trump's several other trial schedules.\n\nThe order sets new deadlines for discovery, including a joint discovery status report on Jan. 9, 2024, and a pretrial motions deadline for Feb. 22, 2024, the last deadline before the rest of the trial schedule will be decided after a March 1, 2024, hearing.\n\nIn Washington, Mr. Smith is prosecuting President Trump in a case that accuses him of illegally interfering with the 2020 elections, and the trial is set for March 4, 2024.\n\nDefense attorneys have said numerous times that they need time to go through 1.3 million pages of unclassified discovery, 5,500 pages of classified discovery, and 60 terabytes of security video footage.\n\nDefense attorneys have said they will seek to compel additional material from the special counsel's office, as well as from the FBI.\n\nThe special counsel's office, meanwhile, is seeking to prevent some of the already-produced classified discovery from the defendants.",

            "body": "WASHINGTON -- The special counsel appointed to investigate Joe Biden's handling of classified documents has interviewed the president's son Hunter Biden, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Hur reached out to Hunter Biden's legal team for an interview about two months ago, a second source familiar with the matter said.\n\nSpokespeople for Hur and the Justice Department declined requests for comment, as did the White House. A lawyer for Hunter Biden did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the interview.\n\nThe White House last month said the president was interviewed Oct. 8-9 as part of the documents investigation after months of negotiations between Biden and Hur over the terms of an interview. The probe was initiated after the White House said in January that documents with classified markings were uncovered at Biden's Delaware home and at a Washington office he used after he was vice president.\n\nThe subject of an investigation typically is interviews near the end of a probe, if at all. Hur's investigation has stretched into its 11th month. It remains unclear whether he is expected to bring charges.\n\nHur is expected to deliver a report with his findings at the conclusion of his investigation, which has sparked anxiety among the president's aides.\n\nSome have privately expressed concern that the probe will conclude with a politically damaging outcome as Biden campaigns for re-election, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.\n\nAdditional concern is swirling within the White House that Hur and, more broadly, the Justice Department are overly sensitive to Republican congressional oversight of their work, a third source said.\n\nMultiple sources also drew comparisons to former FBI Director James Comey's delivering a stinging rebuke of Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign related to an investigation into her emails while she was secretary of state.\n\nWhile Clinton was not guilty of wrongdoing, she was \"extremely careless\" in her handling of classified information, Comey said about four months before she lost the 2016 election.\n\nCongressional Republicans have raised questions about Hunter Biden's proximity to the classified documents that were stored at the president's home in Wilmington, Delaware. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., wrote a letter to the White House in January questioning whether Hunter Biden had access to any of the classified documents in his father's possession.\n\nHunter Biden listed his father's Wilmington home as his address on his driver's license during the time frame when classified documents were stored there. His attorney, Abbe Lowell, has said he did so because the Wilmington house \"was his only permanent address at the time.\"\n\nThe classified documents probe has unfolded as the president's predecessor, former President Donald Trump, is accused of mishandling documents. Trump also faces allegations that he told a property manager at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida to delete security video allegedly showing how his employees moved boxes of documents before the FBI searched the property.\n\nDuring his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump has sought to liken his handling of documents to Biden's. The president's aides have resisted the comparison, arguing that Biden promptly returned classified documents to the government when they were discovered in his office and then voluntarily allowed federal authorities to search his properties for additional materials.",

The charges include willful retention of national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice and false statements.\n\nIn July, Trump was charged with an additional three counts as part of a superseding indictment out of Smith's investigation - an additional count of willful retention of national defense information and two additional obstruction counts.\n\nSmith was also investigating whether Trump was involved in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, and any alleged interference in the 2020 election result.\n\nOn Aug. 1, Trump was indicted on four federal charges out of Smith's Jan. 6 probe.\n\nTrump pleaded not guilty to all charges, which included conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights.\n\nOver in Fulton County, Ga., District Attorney Fani Willis was investigating Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in the state.\n\nHe was charged with one count of violation of the Georgia RICO Act, three counts of criminal solicitation, six counts of criminal conspiracy, one count of filing false documents and two counts of making false statements.\n\nMeanwhile, New York Judge Arthur Engoron ruled that Trump and the Trump Organization committed fraud while building his real estate empire by deceiving banks, insurers and others by overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth on paperwork used in making deals and securing financing. That ruling came after a civil lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nTrump, his family, and his business have been in Manhattan court since October as part of a non-jury trial in order to protect his business empire.

Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing in the case, is expected to quickly appeal to fight what his lawyers have characterized as an unsettled legal question.\n\nAn attorney for Trump declined to comment Friday evening.\n\nIn her ruling, Chutkan said the office of the president \"does not confer a lifelong 'get-out-of-jail-free\u00b4 pass.\n\n\"Former Presidents enjoy no special conditions on their federal criminal liability,\" Chutkan wrote. \"Defendant may be subject to federal investigation, indictment, prosecution, conviction, and punishment for any criminal acts undertaken while in office.\"\n\nRepublican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump stands on the field during halftime in an NCAA college football game between the University of South Carolina and Clemson Saturday, Nov. 25, 2023, in Columbia, S.C. (AP Photo/Meg Kinnard)\n\nChutkan also rejected Trump's claims that the indictment violates the former president's free speech rights. Lawyers for Trump had argued that he was within his First Amendment rights to challenge the outcome of the election and to allege that it had been tainted by fraud, and they accused prosecutors of attempting to criminalize political speech and political advocacy.\n\nBut Chutkan said \"it is well established that the First Amendment does not protect speech that is used as an instrument of a crime.\"\n\n\"Defendant is not being prosecuted simply for making false statements ... but rather for knowingly making false statements in furtherance of a criminal conspiracy and obstructing the electoral process,\" she wrote.\n\nHer ruling comes the same day the federal appeals court in Washington ruled that lawsuits accusing Trump of inciting the riot on Jan. 6, 2021, can move forward.\n\nThe appeals court in that case turned away Trump\u00b4s sweeping claims that presidential immunity shields him from liability in the lawsuits brought by Democratic lawmakers and police officers. But the three-judge panel said the 2024 Republican presidential primary front-runner can continue to fight, as the cases proceed, to try to prove that his actions were taken in his official capacity as president.\n\nTrump\u00b4s legal team had argued that the criminal case, which is scheduled to go to trial in March, should be dismissed because the 2024 Republican presidential primary front-runner is shielded from prosecution for actions he took while fulfilling his duties as president.
