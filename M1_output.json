        "body":["A Florida pest control and lawn care worker has been arrested after allegedly exposing himself to two different women on two separate occasions, according to authorities.\n\nThe Polk County Sheriff's Office said 27-year-old Tyler Mountain of Lake Whales, Florida was arrested and charged with lewd exhibition and lewd exhibition to an elderly person, for incidents stemming back to July and October.\n\nDetectives launched an investigation on Oct. 26, 2023, after a 76-year-old woman told the sheriff's office that an employee of a local pest control and lawn services company exposed himself to her while he was inside her home.\n\nThe woman said the man, later identified as Mountain, was inside, so he could provide an estimate for pest control services.\n\nBut when he stepped out of her bathroom, she told investigators, Mountain allegedly had his privates out and asked for help because his zipper was broken. The woman refused.\n\nDetectives reached out to the company Mountain worked for and were told by a regional manager that Mountain's employment had been terminated after learning of the complaint.\n\nThe manager also told the detective it was the second such complaint the company had received about Mountain.\n\nThe suspect was arrested on Nov. 22 for the October incident, but according to the sheriff's office, the victim of a previous incident in Haines City was not available for detectives to speak with her about the matter.\n\nWhen she returned, a detective met with the victim and learned Mountain was at her home on July 24, 2023, to perform lawn maintenance. While there, he allegedly exposed himself and, like the other incident, claimed his zipper was broken.\n\nDetectives arrested Mountain on Nov. 25 for the allegations stemming from July.\n\n\"This man used his work position to gain access to the homes of these women, and then sexually exposed himself - this behavior is disgusting and predatory,\" Sheriff Grady Judd said. \"We believe it's possible that more victims of this man could be out there, and if that's the case, we want them to come forward.\"\n\nThe investigations into both matters are ongoing. Detectives ask anyone with information regarding similar actions by Mountain to contact the sheriff's office at 863-298-6200."],

She said the family is heartbroken and struggling to understand what happened to their loved one.\n\nThe victim also leaves behind her parents, a twin sister, and two younger siblings, AZ Family reported.\n\nAs of Friday evening, the GoFundMe appeal had raised over $2,100 toward a $5,000 goal."],

According to the sheriff's office, the caller said, \"the home was for sale, and they didn't believe anyone should be present at the home currently.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Oppedisano-Pinkerton was asleep and alone with her two dogs at the house, where she and her husband have lived for the past three years, she told the Citizen Times Nov. 28. The two are living in the home while in the process of selling and moving to a new place.\n\nThe Hyundai Santa Fe, which the unknown caller reported as suspicious, had been parked there most nights for the past three months since the couple purchased it in September, Oppedisano-Pinkerton said.\n\nThe resident said she had just woken up and let her two dogs out in the fenced-in backyard. When she walked into her kitchen, she noticed bright headlights shining in through the window with no flashing police lights.\n\n\"I'm like who the heck is here at 2 o'clock in the morning?\" Oppedisano-Pinkerton said. \"Then I hear dogs start barking and the next thing a heard were three gunshots.\"\n\nMore: Asheville police: Man 'eviscerated' dog at Weaver Park while owner played pickleball\n\nFrom where she stood, all Oppedisano-Pinkerton could see was her dog, Steffie, lying on the ground. After going outside and asking the deputy if they had killed her dog, she said she panicked and ran back inside, locking the door behind her.\n\nSteffie, who was saved three years ago from being euthanized at an overcrowded shelter in Rowan County by Amy McIntosh of a Canton animal sanctuary called Misfit Mountain, was shot three times, once \"in between her eyes\" from 4 feet away, Pinkerton said.\n\n\"During the investigation the deputy encountered an aggressive Pit Bull Terrier that had escaped its containment,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement posted to Facebook. \"The canine charged the deputy who was put in the unfortunate position of dispatching the animal to protect himself.\"\n\nIn response to Citizen Times questions, Henderson County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Johnny Duncan said, \"the statement sent out by the sheriff on our social media pages is the only comment we will have on this incident.\"\n\nMore: Mental health capacity motion filed for man who stabbed dog to death in Asheville park\n\nWhile she was in her home, Oppedisano-Pinkerton said she saw flashlights beaming into the house and stuck her head outside to ask if the deputy was going to take her dog's body. The deputy responded that they don't do that, but he would move Steffie to their backyard.\n\n\"He basically comes, he shoots and kills my dog, drags the body to the backyard and leaves,\" the owner said. \"He left no card, no report, no 'call about this tomorrow,' nothing.\"\n\nPinkerton acknowledged that the deputy felt threatened by his dog, which he said had a \"fierce growl,\" but questioned why non-lethal force, like a taser, wasn't used. But Pinkerton's biggest question was, why did the call necessitate a response in the middle of the night in the first place and why weren't the facts verified beforehand?\n\nMore: Madison County addresses rumors of animal shelter's closure amid staff resignations\n\nMore: More than 40 dogs rescued from Leicester home; horse found dead: Buncombe Sheriff\n\nAccording to what the sheriff sergeant told him, \"About 30 seconds elapsed between the time they arrived, and the time Steffie was shot. I don't think they had a chance to really get their feet down and figure out what was going on. But my question remains, shouldn't you have figured out what was going on before you came out to my house?\"\n\nAccording to the owners, the sheriff's office never called the property, never called the realtor's number listed on the sign out front to see if someone was living there, never checked if the car was registered to the property owners, never announced that they were there.\n\nThe owners of Misfit Mountain, Tera and Amy McIntosh, along with six community members gathered Nov. 28 at the mountainside animal sanctuary in Haywood County, where dogs and cats are fostered from renovated shipping containers. They were calling for justice for Steffie, sharing their condolences and concerns about how the situation was handled.\n\n\"The system failed Steffie in multiple ways,\" Tera McIntosh said at the gathering. \"There were 10 different ways the situation could've been handled. We have to fix the loopholes in the system.\"\n\nAnother unknown is whether the gate to the fence was left open and the dog ran out to the deputy or whether the deputy went to the fence first. Oppedisano-Pinkerton said she remembers closing the gate after getting groceries earlier that day but couldn't say for sure if it was opened or closed at the time. The incident was recorded on officer bodycam footage, and McIntosh said, \"we would like to see that.\"\n\n\"This is the second time this has happened in the two years from the same department,\" Amy McIntosh said. \"Last time, the sheriff went to the wrong house and shot and killed their dog as well.\"\n\nThe Citizen Times requested the incident report for the latest dog shooting as well as the deputy response in 2021 that allegedly led to a different dog fatality.\n\n\"I just want to see transparency,\" Misfit Mountain volunteer Melissa Hartnagel said, adding that she's pro-law enforcement as a retiree from the Michigan Department of Corrections. \"Just show us some transparency, show us what actually happened if it happened how they are posting it on their Facebook page.\"\n\nOppedisano-Pinkerton said Steffie was \"so sweet and happy and excited. She was an example of life itself. For my husband and I, it was like exactly what was missing in our home.\"\n\nMore: Officer shoots rescue dog at Nantahala campsite; investigation underway\n\nMore: Judge: no release of police video of Fletcher man homicide; higher court upends process\n\nRyley Ober is the Public Safety Reporter for Asheville Citizen Times, part of the USA Today Network.

After several failed attempts to smash it open, he picked it up and left.\n\nAnother camera outside captured the suspect's vehicle, which turned out to be identical to the one used about an hour later in a similar break-in at Premiere Nails in Edgewater.\n\nAnalysts at the Volusia County Crime Center used license plate readers in the areas of each salon to identify the car used in the break-ins, a white Infiniti sedan registered to Jones.\n\nWhen detectives reached out to the Orange County Sheriff's Office to make contact with Jones at his address, Orange County deputies found the car parked there and seized it as evidence.\n\nDetectives brought the car back to Volusia County and got a search warrant. They found a mask in the back seat that matched the one seen in the surveillance video. They also found a glove, an abundance of loose coins, a nail salon loyalty card, pieces of a cash register, and broken glass. Black boots were found in the back seat with shards of broken glass stuck in the soles.\n\nIn an interview, Jones denied any involvement in any burglaries and claimed he'd rented out his vehicle to someone else. However, detectives collected DNA from the mask and used Rapid DNA technology to compare it to a sample from Jones, resulting in a match.Jackson, 19, is one of two men arrested for killing Neahmad Alfred, 21, and Tyler Graham, 21, on Nov. 30 according to the Albany Police Department as reported by WALB News 10. Police say the third victim in the shooting, Kesha' Walton, 19, was hospitalized for serious injuries after the shooting."],

        "body":["Bank of America said it is constructive on Vail Resorts' (NYSE:MTN) recent acquisition of Crans-Montana in the Swiss Alps for $143M. Despite the the headline valuation seen being as high at 6X estimated FY24 EBITDA of $6M, the accretive benefits are expected to be an earnings driver.\n\nAnalyst Shaun Kelley said the Vail Resorts (MTN) pickup is a thoughtfully sized investment to increase its foothold in the largest ski market in the world. The firm estimates Andermatt-Sedrun and Crans-Montana represent about one million annual skier visits and just 0.5% of total European annual skier visits, which is noted to leave the company a long runway for future growth with the properties.\n\nKelley noted that at a total cost of $177M including investments, the acquisition can be funded through MTN's cash and is much smaller than MTN's annual free cash flow generation of ~$500M.\n\nMore details on the acquisition: Crans-Montana Mountain Resort spans approximately 4,593 feet of skiable vertical terrain, and 140 kilometers (approximately 87 mi) of trails. Accessible from five airports and by train, Crans-Montana Mountain Resort is located in the Valais canton of Switzerland, approximately two and a half hours from Geneva and less than four hours from Milan and Zurich. The resort is two and a half hours away from the company's other owned and operated European resort in Andermatt-Sedrun. Vail Resorts (MTN) expects to drive significant growth for Crans-Montana Mountain Resort through ongoing investments in the resort and inclusion of the resort on Epic Pass products, attracting a broader population of international guests to the resort who are seeking a high-end destination resort experience in the Swiss Alps."],
