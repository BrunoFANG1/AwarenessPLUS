        "body":["'We're not going to change the minds of Americans,' says White House press secretary when asked about the president's poor approval ratings in national polls.\n\nWASHINGTON-President Joe Biden is celebrating his 81st birthday on Monday as worries continue to grow about his age. The president spent his birthday pardoning two turkeys called Liberty and Bell, carrying out an annual Thanksgiving tradition at the White House.\n\n\"And by the way, it's my birthday today,\" President Biden announced during the turkey pardoning ceremony on the South Lawn. \"I just want you to know it's difficult turning 60,\" he joked.\n\nHe is the oldest president in American history, and if he is reelected, he will begin his second term at the age of 82.\n\nWhile President Biden is optimistic about his reelection chances, numerous polls have shown that his age is a concern for the majority of Americans.\n\n\"Our perspective is that it's not about age; it's about the president's experience,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during a press conference on Monday in response to questions about her boss's age.\n\nWhen pressed about the president's dismal approval ratings, she stated, \"We're not going to change the minds of Americans. I get that, Americans are going to feel how they feel. And we're going to respect that.\"\n\nAnd more than 3 in 5 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they would prefer a nominee other than President Biden.\n\nIn addition, independent voters gave President Biden a dismal 36 percent approval rating.\n\nNumerous polls also found that the majority of Americans are unhappy with his handling of the economy.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasing number of prominent Democrats are urging President Biden to withdraw from the 2024 race, citing his continued slide in polls and domestic and international challenges.\n\nFor example, David Axelrod, the political consultant and strategist who helped launch President Biden onto the national stage in 2008, has called for him to step aside in the aftermath of the New York Times and Siena College polls.\n\nThe polls showed President Biden down in several key swing states and leading in Wisconsin by only a slim two percentage point lead over his rival, President Trump.\n\n\"Only @JoeBiden can make this decision. If he continues to run, he will be the nominee of the Democratic Party. What he needs to decide is whether that is wise; whether it's in HIS best interest or the country's?\" Mr. Axelrod wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, in early November.\n\nThe polling data showed that President Biden was trailing President Trump in Georgia by 6 percentage points, in Pennsylvania by 4 points, in Michigan by 5 points, in Nevada by 11, and in Arizona by 6.\n\nIn addition, his approval rating was 37 percent in the polls, worse than President Trump had in his bid for reelection. Many have compared his situation to that of President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s.\n\nSeveral other political figures have also called for President Biden to drop out of the race. They include former Democrat presidential candidate Andrew Yang and former Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan (D)."],

        "body":["Former Obama adviser David Axelrod warned President Joe Biden that he only has a 50-50 chance of winning re-election and he shouldn't count on Donald Trump helping him win. Axelrod, who has been critical of Biden's age and decision to seek a second term, told New York Times's Maureen Dowd that Hillary Clinton mistakenly thought Trump being the Republican nominee would hand her the election and that Biden should not make the same mistake.\n\n'I think he has a 50-50 shot here, but no better than that, maybe a little worse,' Axelrod said. 'He thinks he can cheat nature here and it's really risky. They've got a real problem if they're counting on Trump to win it for them. I remember Hillary doing that, too.'\n\nRecent polling from The New York Times and Siena College that showed Biden trailing behind Trump in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. Biden is ahead only in Wisconsin, by 2 percentage points. Biden won all six states in the 2020 election.\n\nAxelrod and other Democrats - in the aftermath of the polling numbers - issued warnings about Biden's re-election chances. Biden, in return, reportedly called Alexrod a [expetive], Politico reported. Axelrod shrugged off the criticism.\n\n'I don't care about them thinking I'm a [expletive] -- that's fine,' he told the New York Times . 'I hope they don't think the polls are wrong because they're not.' Biden, who turned 81 on Monday, also faced a new round of low polling numbers.\n\nAn NBC poll had his approval rating at an all-time low of 40 percent but also showed approval of his foreign-policy handling has sunk to 33 percent. 'This poll is a stunner, and it's stunning because of the impact the Israel-Hamas war is having on Biden,' Republican pollster Bill McInturff, who co-conducts the NBC News poll with Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt, told the network.\n\nBut Biden's approval rating is at the lowest ebb of any of any president seeking a second term since Jimmy Carter, polls show. Earlier this month, on the day that was one year out from election day 2024, Biden's Gallup approval rating stood at 37 percent. His number started at a healthy 57 percent when he was inaugurated in January 2021.\n\nBut it began falling after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and was compounded by voters' concern about the economy and rising inflation. Biden was also hurt by a series of verbal gaffes and physical stumbles, and he faces mounting concerns about his age: at 80, he is the oldest American president ever elected. Additionally, a poll earlier this year showed only 37 percent of Democrats wanted Biden to seek a second term, with many seeking an alternative candidate.\n\nBiden also is the oldest American president in history. Despite Trump being just three years younger, polls have shown that Biden is more susceptible to being seen as 'too old' to run for re-election. 'I think that there is one issue that is hanging over him,' Axelrod told CNN on Sunday. 'I think with Donald Trump on the other end, he could still win this election. But the age issue is difficult.'

        "body":["WASHINGTON (AP) - President Joe Biden celebrated his 81st birthday on Monday by joking repeatedly about his advanced age, even as the White House strongly defended his stamina and batted away polling - and one prominent Democrat - suggesting that the issue could cost him votes in next year's election.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the president's age should not be a primary focus.\n\n\"Our perspective is, it´s not about age, it´s about the president´s experience,\" she said while highlighting that Biden had successfully championed through Congress several major pieces of legislation - including a sweeping public works package and initiative on public health and combating climate change - and visited active war zones not controlled by the U.S. military in Ukraine and Israel.\n\n\"What we say is we have to judge him by what he´s done, not by his numbers,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"I would put the president´s stamina, the president´s wisdom, ability to get this done on behalf of the American people, against anyone. Anyone, any day of the week.\"\n\nBiden, for his part, went for humor.\n\n\"By the way, it´s my birthday today,\" Biden told a crowd on the White House South Lawn as he pardoned Thanksgiving turkeys Liberty and Bell.\n\nPresident Joe Biden walks along the Colonnade towards the Oval Office after pardoning the national Thanksgiving turkeys, Liberty and Bell, during a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Monday, Nov. 20, 2023.

At the same time, the White House is strongly defending his stamina and playing down polling, suggesting that the issue could cost him votes during next year's election. Biden is the oldest president in U.S. history. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\n\"I just want you to know, it´s difficult turning 60,\" the president added with a chuckle. \"Difficult.\"\n\nNoting that the pre-Thanksgiving pardoning ceremony dated back 76 years, Biden also said, \"I want you to know I wasn´t there - for the first one.\"\n\nThe oldest president in U.S. history, Biden for months has used humor to try to defuse the issue - even as polls suggest it's no laughing matter. An August poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 77% of U.S. adults, including 69% of Democrats, viewed Biden as too old to be effective for four more years.\n\nAs he seeks a second term, Biden could be headed for a rematch with former President Donald Trump, who is 77 and was the oldest person elected to a first term until Biden was. Trump has himself made some recent, notable gaffes. Yet the same AP-NROC poll found that 51% of adults - and just 28% of Republicans - said Trump was too old for a second term.\n\nTo coincide with Biden´s birthday, Trump released a new letter from his physician reporting that the former president´s \"overall health is excellent.\"\n\n\"His physical exams were well within the normal range and his cognitive exams were exceptional,\" wrote New Jersey Dr. Bruce A. Aronwald, who said he has been Trump´s doctor since 2001 and most recently examined him on Sept. 13.\n\nAronwald added that Trump´s most recent lab results were \"even more favorable than prior testing on some of the most significant parameters,\" citing recent weight loss that he credited to \"improved diet and continued daily physical exercise, while maintaining a rigorous schedule.\"\n\nThe letter doesn't mention Trump's weight, blood pressure, or other test results yet still asserts that he \"will continue to enjoy a healthy active lifestyle for years to come.\"\n\nTrump isn't the only one highlighting the issue.\n\nDavid Axelrod, who helped Barack Obama win the presidency in 2008 and later served as a top White House adviser in an administration that included Biden as vice president, was especially frank recently in comments to The New York Times.\n\n\"I think he has a 50-50 shot here, but no better than that, maybe a little worse,\" Axelrod told columnist Maureen Dowd of Biden's 2024 chances. \"He thinks he can cheat nature here and it´s really risky. They´ve got a real problem if they´re counting on Trump to win it for them. I remember Hillary doing that, too.\"\n\nThat was a reference to Hillary Clinton, who lost her 2016 race with Trump.\n\nJean-Pierre said Monday that the Bidens would spend the president's birthday as they traditionally have, with a family gathering for Thanksgiving on Nantucket, and that they planned to have coconut cake, another tradition.\n\nBut she also attempted to bat away Axelrod's comment while saying of negative polling about 2024, \"There's no alarm happening behind the scenes.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to comment on everyone that has a comment,\" she said, adding, \"It's not my job to tell people what to think.\"\n\nBiden announced his reelection campaign in April and said then that his age \"doesn´t register with me.\"\n\n\"They´re going to see a race, and they´re going to judge whether or not I have it or don´t have it,\" the president said of voters. \"I respect them taking a hard look at it. I´d take a hard look at it as well. I took a hard look at it before I decided to run.\"\n\nJean-Pierre reiterated that voters will make up their own minds, saying, \"We´re not going to change the minds of Americans. Americans are going to feel how they feel, and we respect that.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report from New York.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks before pardoning the national Thanksgiving turkeys, Liberty and Bell, at a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Monday, Nov. 20, 2023.

        "body":["President Joe Biden -- the establishment's installed puppet -- has presided over a comical, catastrophic and tyrannical administration. And people have noticed.\n\nAccording to The Hill, Monday's Morning Consult poll showed Biden with approval numbers substantially lower than those of the least popular state governor.\n\nRepublican Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi earned a 45 percent approval rating. By contrast, Biden checked in at a dismal 38 percent approval.\n\nOn the negative side, too, Biden crushed the competition. The president's 55 percent disapproval rating easily outpaced Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa, who scored identical approval and disapproval ratings of 48 percent.\n\nEarlier this month, Reynolds endorsed Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida for the party's presidential nomination. As recently as 2022, rumors swirled that perhaps former President Donald Trump would select Reynolds as his 2024 running mate.\n\nIn at least one respect, the Morning Consult poll should strike us as depressing. It shows, for instance, that when it comes to evaluating state governors, party affiliation makes a big difference.\n\nHow else could we explain the fact that Democratic Gov. Josh Green of deep-blue Hawaii was rated as the nation's 3rd-most popular governor at 66 percent approval? In the wake of government failures at all levels during and after the Aug. 8 Maui wildfire, that approval rating seems almost impossible.\n\nAs for Biden, the Morning Consult poll hardly qualified as an outlier. According to the RealClearPolitics average of polls for the period between Nov. 1 and Nov. 27, the president has earned a 55.3 percent disapproval rating compared to only 40.7 percent approval.\n\nMeanwhile, in the 2024 presidential race, recent polls have shown Biden trailing Trump both nationwide and in presumed battleground states.\n\nOn the whole, though Biden's popularity has clearly diminished over time, one hardly knows what to make of these polls.\n\nAfter all, the Biden administration has no precedent in U.S. history.\n\nOn one hand, no president has ever exhibited such obvious cognitive decline coupled with inability to perform basic tasks. Biden has often struggled, for instance, with climbing stairs, forming coherent sentences and finding his way off stage. In any other role besides that of a corrupt and ineffectual world leader, he would command sympathy rather than mockery.\n\nOn the other hand, no president has presided over anything comparable to the disastrous 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal. Nor has any administration orchestrated a more brazen money-laundering operation than the Ukraine War. Even with that operation seemingly winding down for the moment, World War III has never seemed likelier than it does now under Biden.\n\nAlas, 40 percent of poll respondents seem not to have noticed. Or, those respondents have noticed and, in fact, have approved of both the incompetence and the tyranny.\n\nHappily, 55 percent have noticed and do not approve, so hope remains."],

'I just want you to know, it's difficult turning 60. Difficult.'\n\nHe also noted that the presentation of a National Thanksgiving Turkey to the White House has been a tradition for more than seven decades.\n\nPresident Joe Biden stands next to Liberty, one of the two national Thanksgiving turkeys, after pardoning them during a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington\n\n'This is the 76th anniversary of this event, and I want you to know I wasn't there at the first one,' Biden said while pardoning the turkey\n\n'This is the 76th anniversary of this event, and I want you to know I wasn't there at the first one,' Biden said.\n\nThe Democrat's age has become an issue as he seeks reelection next year with his administration deploying a 'Bubble Wrap' strategy to stop him from falling in public.\n\nThe President has seen repeated questions over his fitness for office, with polls and pundits claiming it is a huge problem with less than a year to the 2024 election.\n\nWhen asked to respond to concerns about his age by the New York Times, the White House swerved and tried to rattle off a list of his achievements.\n\n'Because of President Biden's decades of experience in public service and deep relationships with leaders in Congress, he passed legislation that has helped to create more than 14 million jobs, lower prescription drug costs, invest in America's infrastructure and technology and led to the strongest economic recovery in the developed world,' White House Communications Director Ben LaBolt said.\n\nBut some of his staffers still believe he needs protecting, with a new strategy being set out to stop him falling or getting lost on stage like he has on multiple occasions.\n\nBiden posted a picture of himself with a birthday cake on the social media platform Threads\n\nPresident Joe Biden, the oldest commander-in-chief in American history, turns 81 Monday and his administration appears set to keep him in a 'Bubble Wrap' strategy to stop him from falling in public again\n\nSome described it as putting the president in bubble wrap until November 2024 to make sure he doesn't trip or fall in public again, like he did at an Air Force Academy commencement in June.\n\nYet other current and former administration officials vehemently disagree and called for him to hit the campaign trail to 'show his vigor' and 'boast about his age rather than ignore it.'\n\nVeteran Democrat strategist Simon Rosenberg is in the latter camp, saying Biden should hit home his age and experience even harder.\n\n'He's been successful because of his age, not in spite of it,' Rosenberg said.\n\n'We're all going to have to make that case because it's true. We can't run away from the age issue.\n\n'It's going to be a major part of the conversation, but we would be making a political mistake if we don't contest it more aggressively.'\n\nBut John B. Judis, a longtime political strategist and author, suggested Biden's age has made him look less presidential.\n\n'He doesn't look and speak the part,' Judis said. 'He's not a commanding or charming presence on a presidential or presidential election stage.'\n\nJudis praised many of Biden's legislative achievements, including infrastructure and fighting climate change but said that his 'public performance' has been poor.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is helped up after falling during the graduation ceremony at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado in June. He fell while handing out diplomas to cadets\n\nThe commander-in-chief stumbled, hit the floor and had cadets and Secret Service rush to grab his arms while he was handing out diplomas in Colorado\n\n'He's fine,' White House Communications Director Ben LaBolt tweeted afterward. 'There was a sandbag (seen left) on stage while he was shaking hands.'\n\n'I think a lot of voters, and young people in particular, who are not at all put off by his political positions or accomplishments, are put off by his utter failure as a regal persona,' Judis said.\n\n'And I don't know how that can be fixed. Not by bicycling. Biden's best hope in that regard is the voters' perception of Trump as a bad or even evil father who wants to wreck the family.'\n\nThe consternation over Biden's age comes as polling has never been worse for the president.\n\nPolling from The New York Times earlier this month shows Biden trialing behind Donald Trump in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe poll of 3,662 registered voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin was conducted between Oct. 22 to Nov. 3. The margin of error for each state is between 4.4 and 4.8 percentage points.\n\nBiden is ahead only in Wisconsin, by 2 percentage points, and falls to Trump in the five other states by margins of four to 10 percentage points among registered voters, according to the poll.\n\nArizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania were four of the states the Democrat beat then-president Donald Trump in during their 2020 White House face-off.\n\nThe same poll revealed that two-thirds of the electorate sees the country moving in the wrong direction under Biden.\n\nBiden has seen many question his fitness for office due to his age, with polls and pundits suggesting it is a huge problem for the president as he's less than a year from the 2024 election\n\nThe consternation over Biden's age comes as polling has never been worse for the president\n\nJust 37 percent of people say they trusted Biden with the economy, compared to 59 percent with Trump - which is one of the largest issue gaps, the polling suggested.\n\nBiden's bragging rights on 'Bidenomics' has fallen short too - with a measly two percent saying the economy was 'excellent' during his tenure.\n\nAccording to the statistics, young voters under the age of 30 are only favoring Biden by a single percentage point - and men are preferring Trump by double the margin that women are choosing Biden.\n\nVoters across all income levels felt that policies under Biden had hurt them personally (18 points disadvantage) whereas Trump's policies had helped them (17 point advantage.)\n\nBiden's senile age of 80 also played a massive factor, according to the data. 71 percent of the pollsters - from every demographic - said he was 'too old.'\n\nComparatively, just 39 percent saw Trump, 77, as too old.\n\nVoters also preferred Trump over Biden on immigration, national security, and on the current Israel Palestine by 12, 12, and 11 points respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden's pull with Hispanic voters is down to single digits and traditionally Democratic black voters are now registering 22 percent support for Trump.\n\nPolling from the New York Times and Sienna Collage shows Biden falling behind in five of the six most important battleground states\n\n'Gallup predicted an eight-point loss for President Obama only for him to win handily a year later. We'll win in 2024 by putting our heads down and doing the work, not by fretting about a poll,' ' said Kevin Munoz, a spokesman for Biden's campaign told The New York Times.\n\nDailyMail.com found out of 1,000 voters in a hypothetical 2024 head-to-head poll Trump takes a one-point lead over Biden.\n\nOne year out from election day on November 5, 2024, Biden's Gallup approval rating stood at 37 percent.\n\nThat is lower at the same stage than his six immediate predecessors - Donald Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan.\n\nOnly Jimmy Carter, who was on 32 percent, was more unpopular than Biden with a year to go, and Carter went on to lose in a landslide.\n\nBiden has raised concerns over his age with recent gaffes from looking confused how to exit a stage at events and slipping up on telling stories."],

        "body":["President Joe Biden's approval among independents -- a key demographic -- is negative on a range of issues, a Gallup survey released Tuesday found.\n\nThe survey found Biden's overall job approval at 37 percent, which Gallup describes as his \"personal low.\" Most, 59 percent, disapprove of the 81-year-old president's job performance.\n\nThe situation worsens when one examines the sentiments of independents, specifically, as Biden's job approval has dropped to what the survey describes as a \"record low\" of 27 percent in that group. This reflects an eight-point drop in approval over the last month alone.\n\nTo make matters worse for Biden, he receives abysmal approval ratings on key issues from independents. For example, just 31 percent of independents approve of his handling of the situation in Ukraine, 35 percent approve of his healthcare policy, 24 percent approve of his handling of the economy, 28 percent approve of his handling of foreign affairs, and a quarter approve of his handling of the \"situation in the Middle East between the Israelis and Palestinians.\"\n\nWith less than a year to go until the presidential election, Biden continues to receive tepid ratings from the American public. His overall job approval rating is still at his personal low and is in historically dangerous territory for an incumbent seeking reelection. In addition, political independents' record-low rating of Biden is striking. Biden's even weaker ratings on the economy, foreign affairs and the Middle East suggest that his performance in these areas is dragging down his overall job performance rating.\n\nThe Gallup survey was taken November 1-21, 2023, and comes as other surveys show Americans viewing Biden as low energy.\n\nA Senate Opportunity Fund poll, first obtained by Breitbart News, found \"old,\" \"weak,\" and \"tired\" as the top three words used to describe the 81-year-old president.\n\nRELATED -- CRASH LANDING! Biden Falls at U.S. Air Force Academy Commencement\n\nThe results also coincide with former President Donald Trump continually blasting the incompetency of the Biden administration and challenging his likely 2024 competitor to take a cognitive exam.\n\n\"Also, and as reported, I just took a cognitive test as part of my Physical Exam, and ACED it. Also ACED (a perfect score!) one taken while in the White House,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Biden should take one so we can determine why he wants Open Borders, No Energy Independence, A Woke Military, High Inflation, No Voter I.D., Men playing In Women's Sports, Only Electric Cars & Trucks, A Weaponized DOJ/FBI, and so many other CRAZY things!!!\" he exclaimed."],

Also ACED (a perfect score!) one taken while in the White House. Biden should take one so we can determine why he wants Open Borders, No Energy Independence, A Woke Military, High Inflation, No Voter I.D., Men playing In Women's Sports, Only Electric Cars & Trucks, A Weaponized DOJ/FBI, and so many other CRAZY things!!!\n\nOn Biden's birthday, Trump released a letter from his personal physician, Dr. Bruce Aronwald, D.O., of Morristown Medical Group, who noted the 45th president's \"overall health is excellent.\"\n\n\"His physical exams were well within the normal range and his cognitive exams were exceptional,\" Aronwald wrote. He also noted that Trump's lab tests were even better than previous testing as a result of weight loss.\n\nTrump has experienced weight loss as a result of \"an improved diet and continued physical activity, while maintaining a rigorous schedule,\" according to Aronwald.\n\nThe same day, a Harvard-Harris poll was released showing that most Americans have doubts about Biden's fitness for office and believe he is demonstrating he is too old to be commander-in-chief.\n\nThe poll found that 42 percent of the 2,851 registered respondents surveyed believe Biden \"is mentally fit\" for office, while 58 percent said they \"have doubts about his fitness.\" Similarly, 66 percent of voters said they think Biden \"is showing he is too old to be President,\" while 34 percent believe he is \"showing he is fit to be president.\"\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Biden Appears Confused During Veterans Day Ceremony\n\nThe poll was conducted on November 15 and 16 (margin of error not specified). Democrats are reportedly concerned about Biden's prospects as he potentially heads to another general election race against Trump, with family members and others close to him worried about perceptions of his age, as Politico's Elena Schneider, Holly Otterbein, and Jonathan Lemire noted.\n\nAlong with political vulnerabilities surrounding age at the forefront of concern, Biden has an abysmal approval rating, worse than any of the last three presidents at similar points in their administrations, according to RealClearPolitics data. Moreover, his approval rating also underperforms Trump's at a similar point in his presidency in FiveTirtyEight's polling data from both administrations."],

        "body":["President Biden has not mentioned \"Bidenomics\" in his public appearances since Nov. 1.\n\nA word once a badge of honor for President Joe Biden might have turned into a political liability. \"Bidenomics,\" a term used to describe his economic doctrine, is being used less, and the press is beginning to take notice.\n\nIn recent weeks, President Biden has refrained from uttering \"Bidenomics.\" It has been absent in nearly all of his public appearances this month, from his prepared remarks in Colorado, where he touted the Inflation Reduction Act, to his speeches at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in California.\n\nThe last time President Biden touted the term was in a Nov. 1 speech in Minnesota, where he mentioned it four times and compared it to the American Dream.\n\n\"Folks, Bidenomics is just another way of saying 'the American Dream,'\" President Biden said then.\n\nBut it has not entirely disappeared. Instead, President Biden's re-election campaign has used the \"Bidenomics\" branding in subtler forms. During the Colorado event, there were signs with the label. The term is also inserted into the title of President Biden's events or speeches. His team has used it in social media messages.\n\n\"In Colorado, [Biden] highlighted how Bidenomics is creating jobs and opportunities - unleashing over $7 billion in new investments across the state,\" the White House wrote on X (previously Twitter) on Nov. 30.\n\nA chorus of prominent Democrats and many of President Biden's allies and supporters have warned that the \"Bidenomics\" branding would backfire because many Americans are still financially struggling and might link their challenges with the economic message.\n\nA plethora of polls have highlighted the same thing: A majority of U.S. voters do not like \"Bidenomics.\"\n\n\"With less than a year to go until the presidential election, Biden continues to receive tepid ratings from the American public. His overall job approval rating is still at his personal low and is in historically dangerous territory for an incumbent seeking reelection,\" Gallup wrote in its summary of the latest polling data.\n\n\"In addition, political independents' record-low rating of Biden is striking. Biden's even weaker ratings on the economy, foreign affairs and the Middle East suggest that his performance in these areas is dragging down his overall job performance rating.\"\n\nThe White House insists that the U.S. economy is heading on the right track, alluding to various data points to support these claims.\n\n\"So my hope is that Americans gradually will see that things are getting better,\" Ms. Yellen said.\n\nThe headline numbers have pointed to a robust economic landscape.\n\nDespite the Federal Reserve's rising interest rates, the labor market remains solid, with an unemployment rate below 4 percent and millions of new jobs in 2023.\n\nHowever, the higher cost of living continues to affect voters' perception of the economy.\n\nThe headline inflation rate remains above 3 percent, down from the June 2022 peak of 9.1 percent. However, cumulative inflation since January 2021 has been more than 17 percent. Plus, there have been many other factors pointing to a struggling population.\n\nPresident Biden acknowledged that families are still enduring a rough environment.\n\n\"We know that prices are still too high for too many things, that times are still too tough for too many families,\" President Biden said on Nov 27. \"But we've made progress.\""],

        "body":["Happy 81st birthday, Mr. President. (I always know when Biden's birthday is because it's the same as one of my kids.)\n\nHe didn't have a big celebration yesterday, unless you consider pardoning turkeys a whole lot of fun - for obvious reasons.\n\nYet plenty of news outlets used the peg for their is-Biden-too-old pieces., and NBC didn't deliver much of a birthday present with a poll showing Biden at his lowest approval rating of 40%.\n\nPolitico reported that when donors asked how to deal with the issue, his deputy campaign manager said to focus on Biden's historic accomplishments, a response that \"was well-received by those who see his age as a mark of his deep experience - and met with disagreement by others, who fear not enough is being done to remind voters that former President Donald Trump is just three-and-a-half years younger.\"\n\nBIDEN CRACKS AGE JOKE ON 81ST BIRTHDAY, THEN CONFUSES TAYLOR SWIFT, BEYONCE\n\nEven close allies \"believe that Biden is mentally up for the job, but some acknowledge that the president can at times appear frail.\" You think?\n\nSome want more joking about Grandpa Joe - Biden said yesterday \"it's difficult turning 60.\"\n\n\"I think everyone knows it's an issue, and we have to address it,\" former chief of staff Ron Klain is quoted as saying. The White House should emphasize that \"it gives him more wisdom and experience, how he's navigated this difficult problem in Ukraine.\"\n\nA CAPITAL PROTEST COUNTERS ANTISEMITISM AS ISRAELI TROOPS ENTER GAZA HOSPITAL\n\nSpeaking of war, 70% of Democrats in that NBC survey disapprove of Biden's handling of Israel's bloody conflict with Hamas. This reflects a deepening divide within the Democratic Party, especially among its youngest voters. In fact, the president's approval rating among those 18 to 34 has dropped to 31%.\n\nAmong Democratic voters overall, 51% say Israel has gone too far, while 27% believe Israel's military actions are justified.\n\nBy any objective measure, Biden has done well balancing rock-solid support, including his trip to Israel after it was brutally attacked by Hamas, with urging restraint as the Gaza death toll soars, but if you view Israel as a terrorist oppressor, your view of the president's role is going to be negative as well.\n\nAnd the sour icing on the cake, so to speak: Trump edges Biden by 2 points in a 2024 matchup.\n\nThere's even a companion Politico piece on how Democrats are coping with all this bad news (in part by rationalizing that he was underestimated in 2020).\n\nNow look at this contrast in yesterday's Washington Post, which, along with the New York Times, has repeatedly been warning of the dangers of a second Trump term.\n\nTRUMP VS. BIDEN: A DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE IN HOW THE MEDIA TREAT EACH CAMPAIGN\n\n\"No president has ever attracted more public detractors who were formerly in his inner circle. They are closely watching his rise -- cruising in the GOP nomination contest and, in most polls, tying or even leading President Biden in a general election matchup -- with alarm. Among them are his former vice president, top military advisers, lawyers, some members of his Cabinet, economic advisers, press officials and campaign aides, some of whom are working for other candidates.\"\n\nMost of the facts here are previously known - the story is true - but the retelling builds a case that not all the criticism is coming from political opponents. Some, including former Trump lawyers Jenna Ellis and Sidney Powell, are trashing their former boss in exchange for guilty pleas and no jail time in the Georgia election fraud case.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting commentary comes from Trump's second chief of staff, retired general John Kelly:\n\n\"I came out and told people the awful things he said about wounded soldiers, and it didn't have half a day's bounce. You had his attorney general Bill Barr come out, and not a half a day's bounce. If anything, his numbers go up. It might even move the needle in the wrong direction. I think we're in a dangerous zone in our country.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe response from the former president's spokesman Steven Cheung is purely Trumpian: \"These media whores are always looking for their next grift -- whether it's book deals or cable news contracts -- because they know their entire worth as human beings revolve(sic) around talking about President Trump.\"\n\nOne thing is certain: No matter the twists and turns of the campaign, including Trump's criminal trials, there is one issue that by definition cannot go away, and that is Biden's age. At least, from his standpoint, he won't have another birthday before the next election."],
